\chapter{My classroom learning}
Dear Diary,

It was a wonderful experience for me to lot important things in the class. I would like
to share some the important things.

\section{Math class}
The equation of Latent Dirichlet allocation is very helpful in natural language processing
for modelling a generative statistical model. The equation of the model is shown below
:-

\begin{equation}
p(\beta ,\theta ,z,w|\alpha ,\eta )=\prod_{i=1}^{K}p(\beta _{i}|\eta )\prod_{d=1}^{D}p(\theta _{d},\alpha )(\prod_{n=1}^{N}p(z_{d,n}|\theta _{d})p(w_{d,n}|\beta _{1:K},z_{d,n}))
\end{equation}

Also the formula of cumulative distribution function in case of uniform probability measure is :-

\begin{equation}
F(x)=\begin{cases}
0, & \text{ if } x<a \\ 
\frac{x-a}{b-a}, & \text{ if } a\leq x\leq b \\ 
1, & \text{ if } x>b 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Counting sort}
Counting sort is one of the nice algorithm which is not comparison based sorting. Below
is the counting sort algorithm :-

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Counting Sort}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1] % The number tells where the line numbering should start
        \Procedure{Counting-Sort}{$A,B,k$} 
        	\State Let C[0,...,k] be a new array
            \For{i=0\ to\ k :} 
                \State $C[i] = 0$ \Comment{Initialization step}
            \EndFor
            \For{j=1 to A.length or n :} 
                \State $C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1$ \Comment{Maintaining count}
            \EndFor
            \For{i=1 to k:} 
                \State $C[i] = C[i] + C[i − 1]$
            \EndFor
            \For{j=n or A.length down to 1:} 
                \State $B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]$
				\State $C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] − 1$
            \EndFor
        \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
